kronos
======

Kronos is a frontend boilerplate project which I'm building from the ground up.

I won't be reinventing the wheel - where current best practice examples already exist in the wild, like H5BP for example, I shall be utilising them whenever appropriate.

I will be posting regular updates on my blog [http://variable-scope.ghost.io/](Variable Scope) as the project develops, to act as a commentary.

Features I shall be including are:

- semantic HTML5 document
- CSS developed using Sass/Compass
